# Bianry_classsification
cats and dogs dataset with cnn'

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying images of dogs and cats using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It covers everything from loading and preprocessing the dataset to building a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
